# Capstone-Documentation
Separate written documentation for our capstone project.

To read our documentation please visit the [Documentation Website]!

## Editing The Documentation
Our documentation consists of simple Markdown files that MKDocs generates into static HTML files when deployed. Any text editor and some knowledge of Markdown will do. You do not need to install MKDocs; unless you want a live-preview or need to deploy.

You can install MKDocs using section in their [Getting Started Page](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/). (Windows users; you can install python from the microsoft store by simply typing `python` into your terminal. Secondly; if the installation does not seem to work you may need to append `python -m` to the start of your commands.)

## Deploying Documentation
Deployment will be done by the acting Team Lead.
