# Coding Guidelines

## Features Branching

## Documentation Principles
To ensure our software is maintainable and reusable, documentation of our code is a requirement. All non-emergency code merged into the `main` branch of our primary repo should have relevant in-line documentation. It is the developer who is submitting the code to repo's responsiblity to write the appropriate documentation.

## API Documentation
Much of our chosen languages have documentation generating comment syntax. This should be used whenever available.

## Web Based Documentation
Non-in-code documentation should be written on this documentation site.
