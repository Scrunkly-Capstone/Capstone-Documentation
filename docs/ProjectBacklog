# Project Backlog


## User Stories
It is the job of the Product Owner and Scrum Master to manage the product backlog. Team members will be directly assigned to (usually) one story at a time, and will be responsible for completing it's tasks in a timely manner.

Team members need to pay attention to their assigned user stories and be mindful of how they work with eachother. Some stories may be dependent on others, so team members should be aware of time constraints and strive to complete dependancy tasks as soon as possible.

### Critical Security Story
This story represents any security related story, bugfix, or feature that needs to be fixed ASAP. Our Cybersecurity Lead can create and schedule these as needed.

### Functional
Functional user stories implement tangible features in the product. They are often immediately usable.

### Nonfunctional
This user story does not provide any immediate features but instead provides other utilities. This can often simply be updating the documentation, configuring a tool, or performing research.
