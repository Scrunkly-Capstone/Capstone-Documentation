## Running Tests locally
In order to run tests locally on your machine, pull a branch which contains tests from the repository.

To run tests on the Server, navigate to the server directory and on the terminal, run the command `dotnet test`, which will run the tests using XUnit and output the results of the tests.

To run tests on the Client, navigate to the client directory and on the terminal, run the command `npm test`, which will run the tests using Jest and output the results of the tests.

If further updates to testing frameworks require different instructions for running the tests locally, this document will be updated.
